# Fitness_Tracker
 
This repository is not having node_modules in both the cases i.e. client and server.

In order to install the packages we can use "npm install"

This will install all the packages which are required to run the code.

Client-Side or Front-End is based on React and VITE. Server-Side or Back-End is based off NodeJS and MongoDB.

To run the code simply open the terminal in the same directory, for VITE we use "npm run dev" and for NodeJS we use "npm run start" as nodemon is utilized here.
